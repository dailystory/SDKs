# DailyStory SDK for .NET
The files and examples here demonstrate how to integrate DailyStory into your .NET application. Documentation is available at [https://docs.dailystory.com/sdk/dotnet](https://docs.dailystory.com/sdk/dotnet).

## Setting up Examples
The [ExampleWebApp](https://github.com/dailystory/SDKs/tree/master/DotNet/ExampleWebApp) is a stand alone fully-functional example that demonstrates how to use the DailyStory .NET SDK. If you would like to use it with your own DailyStory instance or trial, you will need to update the SiteId in web.config and the Web Form Id in each of the sample pages.
